### Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 1
This repository contains my deliverables to the first project consisting of:

* R-files:	plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R-files
* PNG-files:	plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png 

For details about the scope of work see oldREADME.md

### Explanation
The R-files check if the data file (zip) is stored in the directory where the R-files are run.
If the data file does not exist then it is downloaded otherwise the code goes straight to analysis and plotting part, where the required png-files are created.
